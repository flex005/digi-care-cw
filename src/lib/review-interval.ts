 * and are one edit away from disagreeing, on a screen that tells somebody when
 * to look at a person again.
 *

 * home sets frequency per instrument, per domain and per resident: a Waterlow

 * end-of-life plan nobody expects to change. Six months everywhere is a

   * or completing an assessment — the moment the next date is decided.

   * **The default is what this was doing silently.** Until Phase 22 the
   * constant was read directly here and `reviewIntervalMonths()` had no
   * readers at all: the settings screen offered a control whose card said
   * "applies to reviews completed from now on" and which applied to nothing.
   * A control that claims a specific effect and has none is worse than a dead
   * one, because the specificity is what makes it trusted.
