 * the half worth reading. `INVARIANT_PLURALS` and `TERMS_WITH_A_PROPER_NOUN`
 * are each read in both directions, so an exception that stops being needed
 * fails as loudly as one that was never declared. An exception list nobody
 * re-checks is how a guard quietly starts excusing the thing it was written to
 * catch.
 *
 * Every assertion here is about a form being **declared** rather than
 * computed, because the whole argument for this module is that computing them
 * is what goes wrong: §8 records `.toLowerCase()` destroying a label twice,
 * and a two-word term breaks the other direction too.
