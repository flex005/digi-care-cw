/**
 * Date and time formatting.
 *
 * Dates are DD/MM/YYYY. Times are 24-hour. Never MM/DD, never am/pm.
 *
 * **Clinical timestamps render in the site's timezone, never the viewer's.**
 * A dose given at 08:04 at Rosewood Court reads 08:04 to every viewer,
 * anywhere, forever — that is what the care worker signed and what the paper
 * record says. Rendering viewer-local would make the screen contradict the
 * record, which is the core risk wearing a different costume.
 *
 * Every function that formats an instant therefore *requires* a timeZone.
 * There is no defaulted parameter and no viewer-local fallback, because a
 * default is exactly how the wrong zone would creep back in. Components reach
 * these through `useSiteFormat()`, which binds the active site's zone.
 *
 * ESLint bans four `date-fns` names — format, parseISO, formatISO,
 * lightFormat — everywhere, which is what pushes callers here.
 *
 * **That rule does NOT mean a component cannot render viewer-local time.** It
 * covers one import path and nothing else. `toLocaleString`, `toLocaleDateString`,
 * `toDateString`, and `new Intl.DateTimeFormat()` with no `timeZone` all render
 * in the viewer's zone and all pass lint today. The convention is what holds
 * here; the lint rule only makes the convention easy to follow.
 *
 * `src/data/fixtures/medications.ts` already uses `toDateString()` to key MAR
 * records by day. Machine-local, so a site west or east of the runner gets its
 * day boundaries from the wrong zone. Harmless while it is an internal key and
 * both sites are Europe/London; it must not reach Phase 3's grid unexamined.
