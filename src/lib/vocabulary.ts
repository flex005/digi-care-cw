/**
 * What this organisation calls the person it holds records about.
 *
 * **This is the `pluralise` / `quantityWithUnit` / `formatAttributionOn`
 * class** (§6), and it goes wrong the same way: a word whose correct
 * rendering depends on where it appears cannot be rendered by whoever happens
 * to be appending it. "Resident" at the start of a sentence, inside one, as a
 * possessive and as a column heading are four different strings, and a caller
 * that takes one and transforms it will get one of the other three wrong. So
 * the caller asks for a form and this returns it. **Nothing downstream calls
 * `.toLowerCase()`, `.toUpperCase()` or appends an `s`.**
 *
 * **Every form is declared, none derived**, and the argument for that is the
 * plural rather than the capitalisation. "person supported" pluralises to
 * "people supported", which no `s` append reaches, and "next of kin" does not
 * pluralise at all — facts about English that no transform knows.
 *
 * The capitalisation used to carry the argument too, and it no longer does:
 * while these forms were title case, "Service Users" was not the naive
 * capitalise of "service users". **Sentence case made it one.** The claim is
 * recorded as retired rather than left standing, because a justification that
 * has quietly stopped holding is how the next person is persuaded of something
 * untrue. Capitalising a first letter is still not done at the call site — §8
 * records `.toLowerCase()` destroying a label twice, and the same transform
 * run the other way would title-case a term that must not be — but that is a
 * one-owner rule, not an impossibility proof.
 *
 * **The forms are sentence case**, matching `STAFF_ROLE_NAMES` ("Registered
 * manager") and the sidebar's section headings ("Planning and risk"). `label`
 * is title case and deliberately separate: it is the name somebody picks in
 * Settings, not a word in a sentence.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Copied byte for byte from the Admin & Manager build, and kept that way by
 * agreement rather than by any check.** `~/Documents/digi-care/src/lib/vocabulary.ts`
 * is the same file. The two products describe one organisation, so a term that
 * pluralises differently between them is the two builds disagreeing about what
 * the same home calls the same people — and a reader who meets "Service Users"
 * in one and "Service users" in the other has found a defect, not a style.
 * `src/data` already holds 26 files shared on the same footing.
 *
 * **Nothing detects divergence**, in either direction: no script compares the
 * two repositories, and each is a working copy somebody can edit alone. So a
 * change here is a change owed there, and the paragraph above is the only
 * thing that will say so. `INVARIANT_PLURALS` and `DEFERRED_TERMS` are part of
 * the copy for the same reason as the forms.
 *
 * **Where the two builds legitimately differ is in what reads this**, not in
 * what it says. The Admin build has a settings screen that writes a choice;
 * this build has no such screen and should not — choosing what an organisation
 * calls people is an Admin act. See `src/lib/vocabulary-choice.ts`.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why this is safe to make configurable at all.** §10's test is whether a
 * record already stored says something different afterwards. It does not: a
 * care plan is the same care plan whether its heading reads Care Plan or
 * Treatment Plan, and **recorded free text is never touched** — a care note
 * that says "the resident was unsettled" goes on saying it, because those are
 * its author's words and not a label. So this is a claim about presentation,
 * not a term inside a claim the record makes, which is what separates it from
 * the settings §10 refuses.

 * "Planning and risk". `One` and `Many` were written title case — "Care Plan",
 * "Service Users" — and nothing noticed, because the only term that existed
 * when the rule was set was "Resident", which is the same string either way.
 * A one-word term cannot distinguish the two conventions, so the first

 * already in place. §8's entry about a rule that was right for every case it
 * had met.
 *
 * This list is for a term that genuinely contains a proper noun — a product
 * name, a statutory title — where the inner capital is correct. **It is empty,
 * and that is the claim being made** rather than an omission: none of the
 * twenty-nine offered terms contains one. `vocabulary.test.ts` reads it in
 * both directions, so an entry that stops being needed fails as loudly as a
 * capital that was never declared.
 *
 * `label` is deliberately not covered. It is a name being chosen from a list
 * in Settings, not a word in a sentence, and the two fields exist separately
