/**
 * ⚠️ **AN ASSUMPTION, NOT A SPECIFICATION.**
 *
 * The specification requires a gap marker after "more than 4 waking hours" and neither
 * that document nor the source PRD says what a waking hour is. 07:00 to 22:00
 * is invented here. It is not measured, it is not from a care home, and it is
 * almost certainly wrong for somebody.
 *
 * It is a single constant, in one place, precisely so that a real answer is a
 * one-line change touching no screen. Everything derived from it — the gap
 * threshold, the night length, which stretches count as overnight — is
 * computed from these two numbers rather than typed again.
 *
 * **What a care manager needs to be asked**, and PROGRESS.md records this as
 * an open item:
 *
 *  - Are waking hours the same for every resident? They are not, in reality.
 *    Somebody who is up at 05:00 every day and somebody who sleeps until 11:00
 *    are both being measured against this one window.
 *  - Are they the same for every site? A dementia unit and a residential floor
 *    do not run the same day.
 *  - Should the window be a resident-level or site-level record rather than a
 *    constant? If it is per-resident it is clinical data, it belongs in the
 *    fixture types, and it needs its own unrecorded member.
 *
 * Until that is answered, the number on screen is honest about what it counted
 * — the markers state elapsed time and waking time separately, so nobody has
 * to trust this constant to read the record.
