 * Exhaustiveness check for the closed unions in src/data/types/state.ts.

 * compiling — which is precisely Rule 1: "the compiler must refuse to build a
 * screen that forgot the unrecorded case".
 *
 * The throw is unreachable in typed code. It exists for the case where
 * untyped data reaches a component at runtime, and it says what arrived
 * rather than rendering something plausible.
