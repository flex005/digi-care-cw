/**
 * The only way an icon reaches a screen. CLAUDE.md §3.
 *
 * No icon library, ever. No raw <svg> in feature code, no direct imports from
 * src/assets/icons. Names are namespaced by category because filenames repeat
 * across the 57 folders:
 *
 *     <Icon name="medical/stethoscope" size={20} />
 *
 * A name not in the folder fails in three independent places: `npm run icons`
 * refuses to generate, tsc rejects it because it is not in the IconName union,
 * and `npm run icons:check` fails CI.
 *
 * Accessibility: icons are decorative by default — aria-hidden and
 * focusable="false" — because meaning belongs to the text beside them. Passing
 * `label` promotes the icon to an image with an accessible name, for the rare
 * case where the icon genuinely is the content.

    //     A name written somewhere the scan does not read is regenerated
    //     *out* of the registry, `icons:check` reports it current — because
    //     it is, for the wrong input — and this throws at runtime. It is a
    //     valid IconName, so the type system cannot catch it either.
