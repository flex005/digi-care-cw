/**
 * Confirmation dialog. Thin wrapper over @radix-ui/react-alert-dialog.
 *
 * Used for anything consequential: recording medications, changing a DNAR,
 * withdrawing consent, signing a handover.
 *
 * **"Are you sure?" is not expressible here.** There is no free-text title.
 * The caller supplies a `subject` and an `action`, and the component composes
 * the sentence — so a dialog cannot be shipped without naming who it is about,
 * whatever the caller intends. The rule is unambiguous: never "Are you sure?",
 * always "Record 08:00 medications for Emmanuel Okafor?".
 *
 * This replaced `title: string`, which the type could only require, not check.
 * `title="Are you sure?"` compiled, and the rule was carried by review. The
 * first genuinely clinical confirmations — a medication round, a controlled
 * drug's second signature, a stock count that does not reconcile — are being
 * built now, and they must not be built against a shape already known to be
 * unsafe.
 *
 * The subject is also **rendered in the dialog**, not only folded into the
 * title. A title is read once; a subject line is still there while somebody
 * reads the rest and decides.
 *
 * The action button is `large`, clearing the 44px target required of
 * anything destructive or clinical.

/**
 * Who or what a confirmation is about.

 * handover by shift, site and date.
