/**
 * A titled part of a screen, with air around it.
 *
 * The distinction it exists to draw is rank. A screen built as a stack of
 * equally-weighted cards has told the reader that everything on it matters
 * equally, which on a handover is false: the coverage figures, an unsigned
 * handover from yesterday, the residents themselves and the signature are
 * four different kinds of thing and one of them is the reason the screen is
 * open. Rule 3b is usually applied to a status; this applies it to a page.
 *
 * The heading is an `<h2>` and the sections are real `<section>` elements, so
 * the ranking a sighted reader gets from the spacing is the same ranking a
 * screen reader gets from the outline. Colour and size are never the only
 * carriers of structure.
 *
 * `note` is the sentence under the title saying what the section is measured
 * over or why it is here. It is not decoration: on this screen it carries the
 * denominators and the reason Not reviewed leads.
