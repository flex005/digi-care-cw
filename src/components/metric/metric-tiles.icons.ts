/**
 * Icons for the figure cards in Care notes, Handover and Medications.
 *
 * **A map rather than names written at each call site**, because the icon
 * scanner reads the name attribute on an Icon element in JSX, and a name
 * passed as a prop to another component is invisible to it. The name
 * typechecks, the generator sees no usage, and the screen throws at runtime,
 * which is exactly what happened here before this file existed.
 *
 * `scan-usage.mjs` treats every icon-shaped string in a file named for icons
 * as used. That includes strings in this comment, so there are none here: an
 * example name written above cost a build until it was taken out.
