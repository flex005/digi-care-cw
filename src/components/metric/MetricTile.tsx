 * A figure on a card. One definition, used by Residents, Care notes, Handover
 * and Medications.
 *
 * **`of` is required, and it is the reason this component exists.** A big
 * figure on a card looks finished without a denominator, which makes a metric
 * strip the easiest place in a build for a bare count to appear. Here the
 * denominator has nowhere to not be: it renders in the footer and it goes into
 * the spoken claim.
 *
 * **Nothing here is tinted by state.** A gap goes in `figure` as an
 * `<Unrecorded>` chip rather than colouring the card, because the hatch has one
 * owner and a tinted card cannot say whether the tint is the finding or the
 * card.
