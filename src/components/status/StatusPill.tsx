/**
 * A RECORDED status. Rule 3 of the Evidence Invariant.
 *
 * Solid tint, solid border, settled appearance. This is what a complete
 * record looks like — including a complete *negative* record, which is the
 * distinction the whole product turns on:
 *
 *   NO KNOWN ALLERGIES — recorded 12/03/2026     ← recorded, settled, green
 *   ALLERGIES NOT RECORDED                       ← unrecorded, hatched
 *
 * Never use this for something nobody has looked at. That is <Unrecorded>.
