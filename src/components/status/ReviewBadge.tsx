/**
 * Review timing.
 *
 * "'Never scheduled' and 'scheduled and completed on time' must not both
 * render as untroubled." A review nobody ever put in the diary is not a
 * review that is up to date, so never_scheduled is hatched, not green and
 * not blank.
 *
 * In lists, never_scheduled is its own row — absence from a list is the same
 * failure as a blank cell.
 */

/**
 * How loudly to render it.
 *
 * `comfortable` — one resident, one badge, on a profile. Every state gets the
 * same pill treatment.
 *
 * `compact` — a column of 32, where the reader's task is scanning for the ones
 * that need work. Here the two settled states (completed and in date;
 * scheduled and not yet due) drop to plain text, because a green pill on 24 of
 * 28 rows is the loudest thing on a screen whose job is finding the other four.
 *
 * What does NOT change between the two: every state still renders, with its
 * date and author. `never_scheduled` stays hatched in both — a gap is never
 * quieted for density. Only settled facts get quieter, and only where the
 * volume of them is itself the problem.
