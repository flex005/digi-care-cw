/**
 * The single entry point to the unrecorded treatment. Rule 2 of the Evidence
 * Invariant.
 *
 * Nothing else in the project applies the hatch. Two mechanisms hold that,
 * and one gap is left open on purpose — stated here rather than implied:
 *
 *  - scripts/check-hatch.mjs fails the lint if the pattern is REDRAWN
 *    anywhere else. Enforced.
 *  - `label` is a REQUIRED prop, so there is no way to render the hatch
 *    through this component without visible text saying what is missing.
 *    "The pattern is reinforcement, never the sole carrier" stops being a
 *    review note and becomes a type error. Enforced.
 *  - Being the only *consumer* of the classes is currently just true, not
 *    enforced. `composes:` reaches them from any stylesheet, and the guard
 *    script recommends exactly that. A second component composing them would
 *    apply the hatch with no required label and nothing would fail.
 *
 *     <Unrecorded label="Falls risk — not assessed" />
 *     <Unrecorded
 *       variant="panel"
 *       label="Insufficient evidence"
 *       detail="4 of 32 residents have a completed falls risk assessment."
 *     />
 *
 * This is never used for a recorded negative. "Not Given — resident refused —
 * C. Nwosu, 08:04" is a complete record and looks settled; it uses
 * <StatusPill tone="caution">. An omission looks unfinished. Rule 3.
