/**
 * What was decided about one consent.
 *
 * **This badge answers one of two questions.** Who decided it is a separate
 * fact with a separate treatment — see `ConsentAuthority` — because five of the
 * old union's six members said what was decided and one said who, and merging
 * them meant a best-interests decision that concluded *no* could not be
 * recorded at all.
 *
 * `not_sought` is the hatch. Never sought is not refusal and it is not
 * permission: care given without either is care given without consent.
 *
 * **Refused is not a failure treatment.** A resident refusing is them
 * exercising a right, and caution or critical would make the record disapprove
 * of them — the same reason a goal that was not achieved renders quietly.

 * decided and how. Nothing failed: a `Record<string, …>` accepts any key and
 * returns `undefined` for the ones it has not got, silently.
 *
 * Typed this way, a member the map does not cover is a compile error, and a
 * member renamed in `ConsentMethod` cannot leave a screen printing nothing.
