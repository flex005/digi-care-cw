/**
 * Every metric, RAG status, dashboard tile and report figure in the product.
 * Rule 4.
 *
 * No bare counts. No bare percentages. Anywhere. The denominator is not an
 * optional prop and there is no variant of this component that omits it:
 *
 *   not "3 incidents"      but "3 incidents — across 32 residents"
 *   not "92% compliance"   but "92% — 46 of 50 expected notes"
 *
 * Where coverage is too thin to support a judgement, the figure is replaced
 * by Insufficient Evidence in the unrecorded treatment — which is NOT a
 * milder Red. Red is a finding; this is the absence of one, and it never
 * renders in a RAG hue.
 *
 * `value` is the number as displayed: unit 'percentage' with value 92 renders
 * "92%", unit 'count' with value 3 renders "3".

   *
   * `inline` is a form rather than a demotion. On a queue the count *is* the
   * lead fact, but a display card for it puts a large number beside half a
   * screen of nothing and pushes the rows it describes below the fold — on a
   * screen whose whole job is being scanned. So the fact stays the fact and
   * the shape changes.
   *
   * Rule 3b, applied to figures: on a handover, "6 not reviewed" is the only
   * number still fixable before signing, and urgent, needs-attention and
   * all-well are what it sits among; four equal display figures make the
   * reader do the ranking. The denominator survives in all three forms,
   * because Rule 4 is not a matter of emphasis.
