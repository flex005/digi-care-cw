/**
 * End of life care.
 *
 * **A deliberate departure from the Admin build's source PRD**, which specifies grey.
 * Grey is reserved system-wide for unrecorded, so a *recorded* EOLC decision
 * rendered grey would read as "nobody has looked" — Rule 2 failing in the one
 * place it must not. `--status-info` instead: a recorded, factual, neutral
 * clinical state, distinct in hue from DNAR's brand purple and ISOLATION's
 * amber. Recorded in the Admin build's PROGRESS.md so its source PRD can be corrected.
 *
 * Hue is where that distinctness stops: in greyscale these three tints are
 * close, and it is the LABELS that tell them apart. That is acceptable —
 * Colour is never the sole carrier, and the words carry it —
 * but this comment used to claim they "cannot be confused at a glance", which
 * overstated what colour alone does.
 *
 * `not_applicable` is a recorded decision — a manager looked and concluded
 * EOLC does not apply — and is not the same as nobody having looked.
