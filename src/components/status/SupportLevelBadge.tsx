/**
 * How much support a resident needs in a care plan domain.:
 * Independent · Prompting Only · Partial Assistance · Full Assistance.
 *
 * `not_assessed` is a real member and renders hatched, because "Independent"
 * and "nobody has assessed them" are opposite claims about a person's safety.
 * Reading the second as the first is how someone gets left to manage stairs
 * alone.
 *
 * The tone rises with dependency, but the words carry the meaning — the level
 * is never conveyed by colour alone.
