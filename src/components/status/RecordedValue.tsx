/**
 * The general shape, for any clinical value without a bespoke union.

 *
 * The allergies case is the sharpest illustration of why the
 * unrecorded member exists, and why a recorded negative is a third thing:
 *
 *   ALLERGIES: penicillin                          recorded positive, red
 *   NO KNOWN ALLERGIES — recorded 12/03/2026       recorded NEGATIVE, green
 *   ALLERGIES NOT RECORDED                         unrecorded, hatched
 *
 * The middle one is a complete clinical record and must look settled. Only
 * the third is a gap.
