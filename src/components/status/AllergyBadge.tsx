/**
 * Allergies. The sharpest illustration of the Evidence Invariant in the whole
 * product, and the reason `AllergyStatus` has three members. The Admin build's PRD:
 *
 *   ALLERGIES: penicillin                      critical — a finding
 *   NO KNOWN ALLERGIES — recorded 12/03/2026   positive — a recorded NEGATIVE
 *   ALLERGIES NOT RECORDED                     hatched  — nobody has asked
 *
 * The middle one is a complete clinical record and must look settled. Only
 * the third is a hole. A care worker about to give penicillin needs to know
 * which of the three they are looking at, from across the room.
 *
 * Allergies render in --status-critical wherever they appear, and appear on
 * every medication and care screen, not only on the profile.
