/**
 * The product mark.
 *
 * **Not an icon, and deliberately not in the icon registry.** The registry is
 * generated from the Aligned Line Icons set and normalised to `currentColor`
 * (CLAUDE.md §3); a two-tone brand mark is neither one of those icons nor a
 * single-colour glyph, and putting it through that pipeline would flatten it.
 *
 * **Two parts, coloured from tokens rather than from the file.** The artwork
 * ships with its hex baked in — `#6935CF` on the mark and `#1E0059` on the
 * wordmark, which are `--purple-600` and `--purple-900` — and each path
 * carries `data-part` so CSS can override both. That matters because the same
 * lockup sits on a white rail and on a deep purple panel, and brand purple on
 * brand purple is not readable.
 *
 * `tone="ink"` is the artwork as supplied, for light surfaces. `tone="light"`
 * puts the whole lockup in one light colour, because a two-tone mark on a dark
 * ground loses the darker half.
