 * answers "if this document went, what would break". They are one relationship
 * read in two directions, and the second is what makes a viewer worth opening
 * rather than a picture of a page.
 *
 * Derived from the records themselves rather than stored on the document. A
 * list kept on the document would be a second copy of the same fact, and the
 * two would disagree the first time a resuscitation decision changed.
