/**
 * Category-based suggested phrases for the composer. CW PRD CN-02.
 *
 * Ported from the Admin build, where the same list serves the same form.
 *
 * **Openers, not answers.** Every one is a fragment that has to be finished:
 * "Ate ", "Declined ", "Observations taken: ". A suggestion that completes a
 * sentence gets pressed instead of typed, and a care record filled with
 * identical sentences is a record nobody wrote: it looks like evidence and
 * contains none.
 *
 * That is why none of these carries a judgement either. There is no "settled
 * throughout" and no "no concerns": those are findings, and a button that
 * writes a finding is a button that records something nobody observed.
