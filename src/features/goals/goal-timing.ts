/**
 * Where a goal has got to, derived. CW PRD GOAL-01 and GOAL-02.
 *
 * **Ported from the Admin build unchanged**, because the module's central
 * judgement is already made there and is the same judgement here: a goal past
 * its date with a trail of notes that stops short of an outcome is still
 * nobody saying what happened. That is why GOAL-01's lead figure counts every
 * open past-date goal rather than only the silent ones.
 *
 * **Nothing here is stored**, and that is the point: `in_progress` was removed
 * from `GoalOutcome` because as a recorded status it is the stalest claim in
 * the product — set once, never revisited, and a goal nobody has touched in
 * eight months still saying somebody is working on it. Progress is read from
 * the progress notes, which carry their own dates and authors.
 */

/**
 * How long before a review somebody should have been asked.
 *
 * **From admission, and only from admission.** "Past its target date with
 * nothing recorded" needs no constant at all — the date is the threshold, and
 * it is the goal's own. Reusing one number for both because they happen to be
 * the same number is how two meanings end up moving together when only one of
 * them should.
 *
 * Invented, named, and folded under open item §9.2b with the other three.
