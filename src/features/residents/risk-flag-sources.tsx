/**
 * The statuses the Risk flags column is built from — declared, not scattered
 * through a render function.
 *
 * The column runs on one rule, stated in its legend:
 *
 *     Anything not shown has been recorded and is unremarkable.
 *
 * That rule is only safe while every contributing status renders **something**
 * when it is unrecorded. If one of them could render nothing, "no badge" would
 * mean either "recorded and fine" or "nobody looked" — the exact ambiguity
 * this product exists to destroy, reintroduced at the level of a column.
 *
 * So the precondition is enforced by construction rather than by care:
 * `renderUnrecorded` is a **required** field, a status can only reach the
 * column by being in this list, and `residents.test.tsx` asserts that every
 * entry's unrecorded branch produces a visible hatched element. A future
 * addition cannot break the rule silently — it cannot be added at all without
 * declaring what it looks like when nobody has looked.
 *
 * **Scope is deliberately four, not five.** EOLC and isolation are on the
 * profile header, where every state of every badge is explicit. Putting them
 * here would mean rendering "EOLC not recorded" and "isolation not recorded"
 * on roughly half the rows, and volume that drowns a distinction is the same
 * failure as a blank cell. The list is a management instrument; the profile is
 * the point-of-care surface. The legend names the four so "not shown" is
 * scoped to a declared set rather than implying the column covers everything.
