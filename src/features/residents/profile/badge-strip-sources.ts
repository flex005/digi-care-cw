/**
 * The five risk flags of the profile strip, declared rather than hardcoded
 * into a render function. RES-02: all five, always shown.
 *
 * Each source is exhaustive over its own union — every one ends in
 * `assertNever`, so a state cannot go unhandled. What a declared list adds is
 * the guarantee one level up: a *flag* cannot quietly go missing from the
 * strip. The strip is the header's entire safety argument, and the DNAR
 * ambiguity is catastrophic in both directions; a flag that stopped rendering
 * would restore exactly that, silently.
 *
 * Unlike the residents list, nothing here narrows. Every state of every flag
 * is drawn, including the settled ones — this is the point-of-care surface,
 * and inference has no place on it.
 *
 * **These return data, not elements.** The strip renders three lines per flag —
 * the field, the answer, the attribution — and the answer has to be the one
 * thing carrying the status colour, at the largest size on the card. A
 * component returning a finished pill cannot be laid out that way from
 * outside. The badge components still exist and are still used where a pill is
 * the right shape, such as the General Information tab.
