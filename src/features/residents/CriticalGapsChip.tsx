/**
 * The "Critical records missing" chip.
 *
 * Named precisely. It was "Records incomplete", which overclaimed: it fires on
 * a subset but reads as all gaps, and that small inaccuracy is the kind this
 * build exists to avoid.
 *
 * It **names** the gaps rather than counting them. "4 records missing" tells a
 * manager something is wrong without telling them whether allergies is one of
 * them, which is the difference between a chip that prompts action and a chip
 * that prompts a click. Rule 4's spirit: no bare counts.
 *
 * A resident with no critical gaps gets a settled positive, not a blank — the
 * same reasoning as the risk flags column. Non-critical gaps are reported
 * quietly alongside, so nothing is hidden, just not shouted.
