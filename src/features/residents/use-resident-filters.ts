 * residents nobody has looked at, and two decisions here carry that:
 *
 *  - **"Oldest care note" sorts never-noted residents FIRST.** Treating a
 *    missing note as a missing date pushes them to the bottom, which hides
 *    exactly the people the sort was built to surface. Never written up is
 *    more neglected than written up a long time ago.
 *  - **The records filter has two levels.** "Critical gaps only" is the
 *    default because a chip that fires on every resident discriminates
 *    nothing; "Any incomplete record" is one click away, so nothing is hidden.
