/**
 * A read-only field list. Semantic `<dl>`: these are terms and their
 * definitions, and a table would claim a row/column relationship that is not
 * there.
 *
 * The rule this exists to enforce: **a field is never an empty row and never
 * an em dash.** Either it has a value, or it says in words that nobody has
 * recorded one. "—" is the single most common way a care record quietly
 * turns "nobody asked" into "nothing to report".
 *
 * Layout on the wide screen is label-left, value-right, one field per row,
 * hairline between, so the eye can run down the labels and the answers line up
 * against a common left edge. On the compact screen the label sits above its
 * value, because a 240px label column does not fit beside anything at 390px. A
 * field whose value is a paragraph rather than a phrase takes `width="full"`
 * and puts its label above at every width: squeezing four sentences of medical
 * history into a column sized for "she / her" is how a reader stops reading it.
 *
 * Flex rather than grid, because the build is imported into Figma and Figma's
 * importer builds auto-layout from flex.
