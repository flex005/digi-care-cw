 * Today, in the site's timezone.

 * yesterday, and a document expiring today would read as expiring tomorrow —
 * on a screen whose whole job is telling somebody what has lapsed.
 *
 * Not memoised on `now`: the value is read once per render and every screen
 * using it re-renders on navigation, which is close enough for a day boundary
 * and honest about the fact that nothing here polls a clock.
