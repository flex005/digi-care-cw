/**
 * What an expiry decision means today.
 *
 * **Say what kind of instant this is before touching it**: an expiry date is a
 * deadline — the day a document stops being valid — which is the same kind of
 * instant as a review's due date and a different kind from a signature. So it
 * reads `dueSoonDays()`, the constant that already means "how long before a
 * deadline it starts reading as approaching", rather than a second 30 that
 * agrees with the first today and drifts from it later.
 *
 * `today` is the site's day, never the viewer's. At 00:10 in London the
 * viewer's UTC day is still yesterday, and a document expiring today would
 * read as expiring tomorrow.
