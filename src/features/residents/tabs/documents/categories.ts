/**
 * The seven categories, and the order they render in — always.
 *
 * **The screen iterates this constant, never the data.** A category with
 * nothing in it is listed with what it holds, because absence from a list is
 * the same bug as a blank cell: a library showing four headings tells a reader
 * there are four kinds of document, and it is the three missing headings that
 * carry the finding.
 *
 * **The order is the finding too.** Legal and authority is first because a
 * DNAR nobody can produce in ninety seconds is a DNAR that gets overridden.
 * Photographs are last because nothing turns on producing one quickly.
 * Alphabetical would put Assessments first and Photographs fifth — a filing
 * clerk's order, on a screen a nurse reads under pressure.
