/**
 * The Needs tab's sections.
 *
 * Needs are grouped into five (physical care, cognitive and mental health,
 * social and emotional, communication, clinical) and each group maps to the
 * care plan domains it draws on. Between them those five claim **nine of the
 * ten domains**. `end_of_life` belongs to none of them, because end of life is
 * handled under Future Plans instead.
 *
 * Rendering only the five would therefore drop a care plan domain off this
 * screen entirely, and **absence from a list is the same bug as a blank cell**
 * (CLAUDE.md §1). A reader scanning the Needs tab would see nine domains and
 * have no way to know a tenth existed.
 *
 * So the leftovers are computed rather than hardcoded: any domain no group
 * claims lands in a final section. If `NEED_GROUPS` and `CARE_PLAN_DOMAINS`
 * ever drift apart, the domain surfaces here instead of vanishing, and
 * `needs.test.tsx` asserts every domain appears exactly once across all
 * sections.
