 * The two definitions of "critical gap" must be one definition.

 * `recordCompleteness` decides it for now; `hadCriticalGapAt` decides it for a
 * past instant by reading the same records' timestamps. They are separate
 * functions, which is exactly the shape that drifts — an eighth critical added
 * to one and forgotten in the other would be invisible until a figure on a
 * card quietly disagreed with the chip on the row beneath it.
