 * creating a record.** A care note is written, a dose is signed for, a
 * handover is signed — each of those adds something. This one settles a claim
 * another screen is already making: the incident detail says two reviews are
 * owed, and if a re-score cannot clear them that screen stays wrong. An
 * obligation that has been met still rendering as outstanding is the invariant
 * failing in the mirror.
 *
 * Same discipline as `mar-store` and `note-store`: in memory, never touching
 * the fixtures, gone on reload — and the confirmation says so.

 * appearing alongside it: they are the same obligation with different work
 * behind them, and two stores would mean two undo behaviours and two ways for
 * lateness to be lost.
