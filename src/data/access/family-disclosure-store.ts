/**
 * What was disclosed to a family, by whom, and when. AM v2.0 FAM-02 and
 * FAM-03, Phase 21.
 *
 * **Append-only, and never a property of the thing disclosed.** A care note is
 * immutable; sharing one is not an edit to it but a new record *about* it. And
 * un-sharing is a second record superseding the first rather than an erasure:
 * **a note that was visible to a family for three weeks was disclosed**, and a
 * boolean flipped back to `false` destroys that fact entirely. Current
 * visibility is derived from the latest entry, the way a MAR cell derives its
 * state rather than storing it.
 *
 * **One log for notes and incidents, not two mechanisms.** A family message on
 * an incident is a disclosure, not a review finding — which is also what stops
 * it quietly becoming a field on `ManagerReview` later, where it would be
 * indistinguishable from the manager's conclusions.
 *
 * **Nothing here reaches a family.** The Family Portal is a separate product
 * that this build does not contain: no email is sent, no notification arrives,
 * and un-sharing removes nothing from anywhere, because nothing was ever
 * shown. What this records is a decision, and the screens say so at the moment
 * of the act rather than behind a link — see `family-statement.ts`.
