/**
 * Everything this session has written, and the only thing that can end it.
 *
 * **Signing out is the one action in this build that destroys work rather than
 * failing to save it.** Every write is held in this browser tab and sent
 * nowhere, so there is no server holding a second copy and no reload that
 * brings any of it back. That makes the confirmation a real one, which means
 * it has to be checkable: a sentence saying "unsaved changes will be lost"
 * cannot be held against what is actually there, and would be equally true of
 * a session in which nothing happened.
 *
 * **So the list is assembled from the stores, not from the activity log.** The
 * log looked like the obvious source and does not hold what it appeared to:
 * nine of the client's nineteen write functions never reach it, among them
 * every medication round, PRN dose, controlled drug opening count, review flag
 * closed and care plan draft saved. A loss list built on the log would have been silently missing the single
 * most consequential thing a care worker records in a shift, and it would have
 * looked complete.
 *
 * **One owner, and a guard that keeps it that way.** Every store holding
 * session state is imported here, and `scripts/check-session-losses.mjs` fails
 * the build if one is added that this file does not ask. A store nobody asked
 * is work nobody warned about.
