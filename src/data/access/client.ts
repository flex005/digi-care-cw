 * grid would show the missing one as an omission with nobody's name on it.
 *
 * Also refused if a not-given has no reason. The UI disables the button before
 * this; the loader refuses anyway, because a disabled button is a courtesy and
 * this is the rule.
 *
 * **A controlled drug may be recorded with its second signature still to come**
 * (`required_not_recorded`), changed 17/09/2026 for the Care Worker PRD (MED-03):
 * Witness 1 records the dose and Witness 2 countersigns afterwards with their
 * own PIN. Until they do, the dose is half a record and every screen draws the
 * missing signature as its own gap beside "Given". The Admin build's round still
 * takes both signatures in one act; it simply never sends a dose without one.
