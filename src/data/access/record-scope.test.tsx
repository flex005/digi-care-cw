/**
 * A record is read at the home that holds it. Phase 29.
 *
 * **The switcher was the visible half.** A manager appointed to one home could
 * type another home's resident URL and read the whole profile: `getResident`
 * took an id and no home, and the shell's gate is per module rather than per
 * record. Every screen reading that record was wrong in the same way, which is
 * why the check is at the loader rather than on the route.
 *
 * **The assertion that matters is the one with a viewer set.** "No viewer
 * means no scope" is deliberate — every product screen sits behind the sign-in
 * gate, so a loader reached without one is a sign-in screen or a test — but it
 * is also exactly the shape somebody could satisfy the rule with by never
 * setting a viewer, and nothing would say so. So the refusals here are
 * asserted with a viewer set, by name.
