/**
 * Who a family has named to see a resident's updates. AM v2.0 FAM-01,

 *
 * **The basis for access is not held here.** That is the resident's
 * `family_portal` consent, recorded through the capacity gate like every other
 * consent. Recording the basis here as well would be two places holding one
 * fact, and the one that goes stale is whichever the reader is looking at.
 *
 * **There is no `invited` state.** AM v2.0 has one, and it implies an email in
 * flight and a status that turns Active. Nothing is sent and nothing can
 * activate, so the state would be permanent and its name a promise. See
 * `family-statement.ts`.
 *
 * **Fixtures plus this session's writes**, the shape the activity store
 * settled: the fixtures are never mutated, so a removal is a note that this
 * session removed it, and a correction is a revision appended beside it.

 * every member already named carries the level they were granted, and changing
 * this moves none of them. So it needs no second rendering rule and no pair.
 *
 * The site-wide on/off switch AM v2.0 also asks for is refused, and the reason
