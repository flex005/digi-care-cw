/**
 * The figures this build runs on, and which of them can honestly move. Phase 15.
 *
 * **Settable if and only if it is read at render.** A figure baked into fixture
 * generation cannot be changed by a control: the records were already produced
 * against the old value, so the control would move a label and not the data —
 * which is the largest "control that does nothing" available, on the screen
 * where somebody most reasonably expects otherwise.
 *
 * Only one of the §9.2b figures turns out to be baked. `MEDICATION_LOOKAHEAD_HOURS`
 * decides which MAR records are generated as `due`, so changing it means
 * regenerating rather than re-rendering. Everything else here is read while a
 * screen draws, and changing it genuinely changes what that screen says.
 *
 * In memory and nowhere else, like every other write in this build — and that
 * is exactly why every screen says when one has been changed.
