/**
 * Acknowledging an incident, and what the manager concluded. Phase 20.
 *
 * **The reporter's record and the manager's are two records by two people, and
 * this store never touches the first.** `ImmediateResponse.immediateAction` is
 * what the person who was there wrote at the time; `ManagerReview.actionsTaken`
 * is what somebody concluded later. The type has said so since Phase 4 and a
 * write path is where that quietly stops being true — one patch that spreads
 * over the whole incident, one helper that "fills in" a blank from the other
 * field, and the record now attributes one person's account to another.
 *
 * So the patch is typed to the manager's fields only. There is no way to reach
 * `response` from here, which is stronger than remembering not to.
 *
 * **Everything is in memory and nothing is merged into the fixtures.** The
 * overlay is applied at read time, the same shape `resident-store` uses.
