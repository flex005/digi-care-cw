/**
 * Planning, changing and cancelling a session. AM v2.0 ACT-01, Phase 20.
 *
 * **Cancelling never removes an attendance record**, and that is the whole of
 * the design here. AM v2.0 says a confirmation asks before removing partially
 * recorded attendance; this build does not remove it and the confirmation says
 * what stays instead. Somebody wrote that a resident came, with their name and
 * the time on it, and a later decision about the session does not make that
 * untrue — a cancellation that discarded them would be a record editing
 * itself, which is the shape consent withdrawal refused for the same reason.
 *
 * So `cancel` writes a standing beside the record and touches neither
 * `invited` nor `joined`. There is no code path from here to either.
 *
 * **Edits are field by field on a session, never a re-save of the whole
 * thing.** A session edited by replacing it loses whoever planned it and when,
 * which is the attribution every record in this build carries.
