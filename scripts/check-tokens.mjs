/**
 * Every `var(--token)` names a token that exists.
 *
 * **Written the hour it was needed.** Phase 17 used `--text-small-size`,
 * `--text-small-line`, `--ink-600` and `--radius-8`. None of the four exists.
 * Nothing failed: stylelint's colour rule sees a `var()` and is satisfied,
 * `tsc` does not read CSS, the build succeeded, the tests passed, and the
 * screens rendered with the text at whatever size it inherited.
 *
 * That is the class this build keeps meeting from new directions — a value
 * that is correct in the source and absent on screen — and this one is the
 * cheapest variant to catch, because an undefined custom property is a string
 * that does not appear in `tokens.css` and a script can see that.
 *
 * It matters more than a typo: CLAUDE.md §4 says the type scale is closed at nine steps
 * and colour reaches a component only as a token. A misspelled token is a
 * silent departure from both, and it looks exactly like compliance.
 *
 * Local properties declared in the same file are fine: a stylesheet may define
 * its own `--row-height` and use it. What is checked is that a reference
 * resolves somewhere the author can point at.
