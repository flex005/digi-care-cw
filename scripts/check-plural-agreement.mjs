/**
 * A count beside a configurable plural agrees with it, through `pluralise`.
 *
 * **Why this one is enforceable where two others were refused.** §8 records
 * the lowercasing guard and the clock-ordered-fixture guard both being costed
 * and thrown away, because what they were looking for was arbitrary prose with
 * nothing mechanical in it. This shape is different: **both halves come from
 * known owners.** The count is a `formatCount(…)` call or a `.length`, and the
 * word is a declared plural form read out of `src/lib/vocabulary.ts` rather
 * than guessed. Two named things a script can recognise.
 *
 * **Why it is needed at all.** This class has got through three times — the
 * incident video note, the activities invitation, and seven handover and
 * dashboard denominators that would have read "of 1 service users reviewed
 * this shift" on any shift where one person had been marked. `check-plurals`
 * cannot see any of them: it looks for a count agreeing with its word **in one
 * expression**, and in every one of these the count and the word are separate
 * expressions. That guard is narrower than its name.
 *
 * `pluralise(n, term.one, term.many)` is the owner. A conditional written at a
 * call site is a second copy of the rule, so it is not accepted here either.
 *
 * `// plural-ok: <why>` opts out per site, and the count is printed.
 *
 * **Ported from the Admin & Manager build, where it was written after nineteen
 * real defects** — eighteen found by hand and the nineteenth by the guard
 * itself, once it existed, with zero opt-outs over there. It arrives here
 * before any copy has been made configurable, which means **its first run
 * reports nothing and proves nothing**: a guard that has only ever passed has
 * not been shown to be able to fail. It was broken on purpose before it was
 * trusted, and PROGRESS.md records what the mutations were.
